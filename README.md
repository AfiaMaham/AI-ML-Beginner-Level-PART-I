##  What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed. It uses algorithms to find patterns in data and make predictions or decisions.

##  Types of Machine Learning

###  Supervised Learning
- Learns from **labeled data** (input-output pairs).
- **Goal:** Predict output for new inputs.
- **Examples:** Linear Regression, Decision Trees, SVM.
- **Use Cases:** Spam detection, house price prediction.

###  Unsupervised Learning
- Works on **unlabeled data** (no output labels).
- **Goal:** Find hidden patterns or groupings.
- **Examples:** K-Means Clustering, PCA.
- **Use Cases:** Customer segmentation, anomaly detection.

###  Reinforcement Learning
- Learns by **interacting with the environment**.
- Uses **rewards and punishments** to learn actions.
- **Examples:** Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN).
- **Use Cases:** Game playing (e.g., AlphaGo), robotics.

##  Difference Between AI, ML, and Deep Learning (DL)

| Feature     | Artificial Intelligence (AI)         | Machine Learning (ML)                  | Deep Learning (DL)                          |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Definition** | Simulating human intelligence       | Subset of AI that learns from data     | Subset of ML using neural networks          |
| **Goal**       | Enable smart behavior               | Learn from data to make decisions      | Mimic human brain to solve complex problems |
| **Approach**   | Rule-based or learning-based        | Data-driven model training             | Uses deep neural networks                   |
| **Examples**   | Chatbots, expert systems            | Spam filters, fraud detection          | Image recognition, speech recognition       |
